### [0. Binary to Unsigned Int](./0-binary_to_uint.c)
> Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
### [1. Print Binary Number](./1-print_binary.c)
> Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number
### [2. Finds value of a specific bit](./2-get_bit.c)
> Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
### [3. Sets a specific bit to 1](./3-set_bit.c)
> Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
### [4. Sets a specific bit to 0](./4-clear_bit.c)
> Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
### [5. Difference between two binaries](./5-flip_bits.c)
> Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
