# C programming: Dynamic Libraries
## General Concept Guidance:
* [What is a C Library?](http://docencia.ac.upc.edu/FIB/USO/Bibliografia/unix-c-libraries.html#what_is_a_library)
### [0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life](./libholberton.so)
> Create the dynamic library libholberton.so
### [1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future](./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh)
> Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory
### [2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing](https://medium.com/@864/linux-libraries-e62cac7f3f5)
> Write a blog post describing the differences between static and dynamic libraries
### [100. Let's call C functions from Python](./100-operations.so)
> Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python
