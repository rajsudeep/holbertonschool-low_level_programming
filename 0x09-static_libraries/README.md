# C programming: Static Libraries
## General Concept Guidance:
* [What is a C Library?](http://docencia.ac.upc.edu/FIB/USO/Bibliografia/unix-c-libraries.html#what_is_a_library)
* [Creating a Static C Library (ar and ranlib)](http://docencia.ac.upc.edu/FIB/USO/Bibliografia/unix-c-libraries.html#creating_static_archive)
* [Using a C Library](http://docencia.ac.upc.edu/FIB/USO/Bibliografia/unix-c-libraries.html#using_static_archive)
* [C Static Libraries](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/61)
### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
> Create the static library libholberton.a
### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
> Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
### 2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
> Write a [blog post]() on C static libraries. It should cover
> * Why use libraries
> * How they work
> * How to create them
> * How to use them
