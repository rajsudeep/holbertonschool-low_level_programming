### [3. make -f 3-Makefile](./3-Makefile)
> * name of the executable: holberton

  >   * CFLAGS: your favorite compiler flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
### [5. Island Perimeter](./5-island_perimeter.py)
> Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:
> * grid is a list of list of integers:
  >   * 0 represents a water zone
  >   * 1 represents a land zone
  >   * One cell is a square with side length 1
  >   * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
  >   * Grid is rectangular, width and height donâ€™t exceed 100
